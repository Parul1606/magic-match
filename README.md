## **Description üìÉ**

Welcome to the memory game, it is a popular cognitive activity that challenges players to remember and recall a series of information or patterns. The game typically involves a set of cards or tiles, each containing a symbol, number, or image. The objective is to match pairs of identical cards by flipping them over, one at a time, to reveal their contents.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**

1. Preparation: Start by gathering a set of matching pairs of cards. You can use playing cards, picture cards, or even create your own with drawings or printed images. Shuffle the cards and lay them face-down in a grid-like arrangement on a table or any flat surface.

2. Turn-Taking: The game usually begins with the first player flipping over two cards of their choice. They should remember the location and content of each card as they are revealed to all players.

3. Matching: If the two cards flipped over by the player are a pair (i.e., they have the same symbol or image), the player keeps the cards and earns a point. The player gets another turn to flip over two more cards. If the cards do not match, they are turned face-down again, and it becomes the next player's turn.

4. Memory and Recall: As the game progresses, players need to rely on their memory to recall the positions of previously flipped cards. The more pairs they remember, the better their chances of making successful matches in subsequent turns

5. Alternate Turns: Players take turns flipping over cards until all pairs have been matched. The game continues until all cards are cleared from the playing area.

6. Scoring: At the end of the game, players count their pairs to determine their scores. The player with the most matched pairs wins the game.
